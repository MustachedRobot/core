## Roadmap

### Beta version (september)

_The beta version is a completely functional application on its own but a little nerdy to install_

* Coworkers can create an account and checkin in the coworking space
* Coworking space managers can access the coworking space datas on a beautiful dashboards: coworkers currently here, coworkers profiles, coworking space statistics
* A Dashboard view with the coworkers profiles and the next events in the coworking space (this view can be used on a large TV screen in the coworking space)
* An API is available so any allowed developer can play with the coworking space datas
* Mobile ready

### V1

_The V1 is an easy-to-install, easy-to-extend plateform_

* Install wizard (database configuration, google calendar credentials, creation of the first admin user)
* Plugin system to allow anyone to develop plugins without needing to change the core files (example: a billing management system through Freshbook, a connection to a specific CRM, etc).
